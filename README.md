## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/ankit-rks/ecommerce.git
   cd ecommerce
   ```

2. Build and run the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build and start both the Django backend and React frontend containers.

3. Access the applications:

   - Django backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - React frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

   - Run command `python manage.py createsuperuser` and fill the promted question.

## Notes

- The Django backend is accessible at port 8000, and the React frontend is accessible at port 3000.
- The Django application is set up to run migrations automatically on startup.
- Make sure to replace placeholders such as `ankit-rks` and `ecommerce` with your actual GitHub username and project name.

## Environment Variables

- Django backend uses the default Django development settings.
- React frontend uses an environment variable for the API URL. Modify the `REACT_APP_API_URL` variable in the frontend Dockerfile if needed.

## Additional Configuration

Feel free to customize the Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, and any other project files according to your specific requirements.
